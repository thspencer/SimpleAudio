SimpleAudio
=========

A simple audio conversion script that will convert any FFmpeg compatible audio format to any other FFmpeg compatible audio format.  The script defaults to converting English DTS audio streams to AC3 5.1.

This was originally part of a utility I wrote for personal use in the conversion of various media files to a TiVo compatible media file. Currently this works very well with a Roku 3 streamed with Plex Media Server.
